Shallow Copy:
In a shallow copy, only the top-level structure of the object is duplicated. 
If the object being copied contains references to other objects(Attribute object of Clone/copied object), those references are copied (not the objects themselves). 
As a result, both the original object and the shallow copy share references to the same objects.

Deep Copy:
In a deep copy, not only is the top-level structure of the object duplicated, but any objects referenced by it are also recursively duplicated.
This ensures that the copied object and all objects referenced by it are completely independent of the original object and any objects referenced by it.
